# Hulk Example Blog

This is an example blog used to demonstrate the [Hulk](http://github.com/jpoehls/hulk) static site generator.

Run the `./gen` script to generate the site.

This example is mostly used for testing hulk and as such it expects that `hulk` and `hulk-cli` are in sibling directories. Use `npm link ../hulk` to install the hulk dependency. Don't use `npm install`.
